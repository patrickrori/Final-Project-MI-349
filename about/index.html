        <p>
          Growing up near Detroit, Michigan, automotive culture has been a part of my life since the very start.<br>  Coming from a family of engineers, working on cars has been a large part of my life.<br>  However, I took an interest into media in high school and started to photograph and make videos of cars around me.<br>  Fast-forward a couple years, I've doubled downed on media and am attending college for such a career path.  <br>Working as a media intern for a Michigan based racing company, I started Driveway Media as a means of getting money out of an unpaid internship.<br>Now, running a media company based on passion, I am able to create meaningful content for clients.<br><br>
